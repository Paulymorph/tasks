# Tasks
This is a repository for my solutions of different programming tasks. Like [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com) or [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com).
Currently I try to solve the tasks on Scala using immutable approach, as the most solutions are stuck in mutations. I also try to have my solutions structured, clean of meaningless naming.
